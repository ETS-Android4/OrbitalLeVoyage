Proposed level of achievement: Apollo 11

Click [here](https://github.com/tsy24/OrbitalLeVoyage/raw/master/LeVoyage.apk) to download the apk

## Motivation ##
When you are trying to plan your own trip, be it overseas or local, you realise you have been switching between numerous websites and applications, 
picking up bits and pieces of information from various places and trying to put everything together to form your itinerary.

Many may have reached the point where everything feels like a mess as the information you need is scattered around various sources. 
Furthermore, you donâ€™t know where to get certain information from. So why isn't there a place where you can find and put all the information you need for your trip together, 
all organised in one place?

## Aim ##
We hope to make trip planning processes simpler by bringing different aspects of trip planning all together in one application.

## User Stories ##
1. As a person planning my own trip to a country, I would like to know what are the popular attractions and restaurants that I can visit during my trip.
2. As a person planning my own trip to a country, I would like to plan an itinerary and have a comprehensive schedule that I can refer to.
3. As a person planning my own trip to a country, I would like to have a place to write down relevant important information that I can refer to together with my itinerary.
4. As a person planning my own trip to a country, I would like to know about the travelling time needed between locations when planning my itinerary for 
more efficient allocation of time.
5. As a tourist guide, I would want to be able to write reviews for hotels, attractions and restaurants.
6. As a local citizen, I would want to look up the reviews and ratings to decide leisure destinations during short public holidays.
7. As a frequent traveller, I would like to share my travelling experiences with the public.

## Scope of Project ##

1. A ***Scheduler*** allows users to arrange their itinerary during the trip and will be the main page of the application 
2. A ***Map*** feature will be provided for the users to search for locations on the map. Transportation methods will also be shown when searching for directions. 
3. A ***Hotel Search*** feature
    * Attached with brief details such as description and address
    * Links to websites for hotel bookings
    * Users can post reviews and ratings of attractions
4. An ***Attraction Search*** feature
    * Attached with brief details such as descriptions and address
    * Users can post reviews and ratings of the attractions
5. A ***Restaurant Search*** feature
    * Attached with brief details such as description and address
    * Users can post reviews and ratings
6. ***Checklist*** feature for users to check their to-do tasks or create a packing list.
7. ***Notes*** provides a platform for users to write down any other information
8. Displaying 5-day ***Weather Forecast*** for an area.

## How are we different from similar platforms? ##
* Klook and Trip.com:
  * Only shows the booking of different attractions and accommodations, without having a clear visible schedule for reference
  * No link to map to show the location of the place, find directions and compare the distance between accommodations and attractions booked
  * No feature to jot down important notes
* TripIt: Travel Planner
  * A mobile application that creates itineraries
  * Does not contain features that help users find suitable accommodation, attractions and restaurants

## Software Development ##

### Considerations ###
* Goals
   * The application should be comprehensive to minimise the need to refer to other applications or websites when planning an itinerary. Thus, the features of the application should include most things that people need when planning an itinerary.
   * User interface should be simple and easy to use.
* Assumptions
   * It is assummed that the user will have connection to the internet.
* Constraints
   * We are unable to obtain a datbase of hotels, attractions and restaurants. Thus, an API will be used to obtain information required.

### System Flow ###
![Untitled drawing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77200594/126892453-cb826212-fcb2-4333-905e-e035767f2bd1.jpg)
![Orbital System Flow (4)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77200594/126510669-d2e0a276-5bf8-494a-a980-dfbef968c7a2.jpg)

### Database Structure ###
![Database ER diagram (3)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77200594/126511888-d4c51063-4514-4f4d-a046-d191729846b4.jpg)

The diagram above shows the structure of the Firebase Realtime Database. The main Users branch stores the information of each user: itinerary, notes and checklist. Only the user himself will have read and write access to the information stored in Users under their userID. Users' itineraries are stored as ItineraryItems. AccommodationItineraryItem, AttractionItineraryItem and FoodItineraryItem are subtypes of ItineraryItem and they inherit the fields of ItineraryItem. The Profiles branch stores information about each user that is available to all users. The Reviews branch stores reviews for locations based on their locationID.

### Software Testing ###
System testing was carried out to check for bugs and ensure that the application runs smoothly. Test cases were planned based on the possible usage of the various features in the application.

Apart from testing the features, tests for the error messages and error prevention mechanisms were also carried out to ensure that the application runs smoothly.

### Limitations ###
* Travel Advisor API
   * The search results obtained from the accommodation, attractions and food features depend on the Travel Advisor API. The results returned may not be up-to-date and may not be comprehensive. As a result, users might not be able to find some locations on the application. Therefore, there is the option for users to add custom events to their itinerary on the itinerary page.
* Reviews
   * As we do not have a big user database to write reviews and gather ratings for our reviews database, most of the locations do not have reviews currently. The ratings shown for the locations are currently retrieved from the Travel Advisor API.
* Directions
   * As we are unable to get access to the Directions API, the application currently does not have a directions feature where users can search for directions in the application. Users will be directed to the maps application on their phones to search for directions.

### Possible Future Work ###
There are some improvements to the application that we thought of and gathered from user feedback. However, due to time constraints, we were unable to work on them.
* Markings on Calendar to indicate that there is itinerary for that date
* Directions function
* Placeholder for empty recycler views in itinerary, notes, checklist and search pages
