# Le Voyage #
An all-in-one travel planning application

## Motivation ##
When you are trying to plan your own trip, be it overseas or local, you realise you have been switching between numerous websites and applications, 
picking up bits and pieces of information from various places and trying to put everything together to form your itinerary.

Many may have reached the point where everything feels like a mess as the information you need is scattered around various sources. 
Furthermore, you don’t know where to get certain information from. So why isn't there a place where you can find and put all the information you need for your trip together, 
all organised in one place?

## Aim ##
We hope to make trip planning processes simpler by bringing different aspects of trip planning all together in one application.
